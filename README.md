# Challenge-364-Easy-Create-a-Dice-Roller
I love playing D&amp;D with my friends, and my favorite part is creating character sheets (my DM is notorious for killing us all off by level 3 or so). One major part of making character sheets is rolling the character's stats. Sadly, I have lost all my dice, so I'm asking for your help to make a dice roller for me to use!
